## How to run this project ?

1. Clone this Repo
2. install [vscode live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and enable it.
3. Open the cloned repo in vscode and click on "Go Live" (bottom right corner) in vscode, after installing and enabling it in step 2.
4. By now, if you've following correctly, and assuming the live server is running on port 5500 , then clicking on http://localhost:5500/frontend shoud take you to the homepage of the frontend.
5. For starting the backend server, go to the backend folder in the repo and run <br>
```npm install``` followed by <br>
```npm run dev``` 
6. Ideally, this should start the backend server, possibly on port 5000
7. By now, the frontend would be running on http://localhost:5500/frontend and the backend would be running on http://localhost:5000
8. Enjoy, checking out the app.
